- You are a cruiser who's flagship Dreadnought was destroyed in the last battle against the Empire of the Burning Star. To make things worse, your FTL system(Faster Than Light System) has ran out of energy, and you cannot travel back to your home system without charging it! Charge your FTL system and fight off the space pirates which seek to defeat you.

- The player can shoot a projectile, a laser, by pressing E or the spacebar.

- If an enemy gets past the player, the player loses an HP.
- RareCollects, rockets, in addition to milestone #1, temporarily give the player immunity to collisions with enemy projectiles or the enemy entity itself.
